													<h3>Allison Claire Ham</h3>
													<h4>Postdoctoral Researcher</h4>
													<p>Allison holds a PhD in Anthropology from the University of South Carolina, and her research is motivated by questions surrounding the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that produce sexual variation in health outcomes across diverse cultural, ecological, and temporal contexts. Allison’s postdoctoral research combines paleodemographic and biomolecular methods to 1) explore the effects of demographic factors (age and sex) on the diversity and composition of the human oral microbiome and 2) investigate how variation in microbiota diversity and composition effects sex-based health outcomes, as manifested in variation in risks of mortality. Allison aims to expand our understanding of the environmental, biological, and cultural factors that are driving sex-based health disparities both in the past and present.  </p>

													<h4>Graduate Student</h4>
													<p>Christine is a graduate student interested in how cultural practices introduced or spread during the Great Acceleration (post World War II) have impacted the human microbiome, specifically the increased and expansive use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. As antibiotic resistance is a rising global concern, Christine aims to contextualize the evolutionary history of antimicrobial resistance genes within the oral microbiome in hopes of understanding the potential link between antibiotic use and the shift in disease landscape in the last 70 years observed in modernized societies with a deep history of industrialization.</p>
