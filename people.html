													<h3>Christine Ta</h3>
													<h4>Graduate Student</h4>
													<p>Christine is interested in studying the oral microbiome to gain insights into the evolution of systemic diseases in conjunction with the human immune system. Because most infections do not manifest pathological lesions in bones, child deaths in archaeology are still largely a mystery. Using dental anthropology and paleopathology, she wants to explore speculations of infectious diseases in the children demographics seen in archaeology. She aims to bridge the gap between children’s archaeology with paleoepidemiology using aDNA found in dental calculus. .</p>

													<h4>Graduate Candidate</h4>
													<p>Abby is a third year graduate student working with Dr. Weyrich. She recieved her bachelors degree in public health and anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2019. Her research focuses on the applications of ancient oral microbiomes to paleoepidemiological research. Her current research focuses on the intersections of systemic disease, frailty, and microbes in ancient populations.</p>
